/**
 * Stream an OME-Zarr pyramid as a {@link ChunkedVolumeSource}.
 *
 * This is the whole-store streaming path: `nv.loadChunkedVolume` plans a
 * multi-LOD brick set, and this adapter reads each brick's voxel region from
 * one pyramid level with zarrita. The core owns plan-building, per-level
 * dispatch, concurrency, retry, dedup and GPU residency; this module only
 * moves bytes. (For whole-level, per-channel loading of modest stores, use
 * `omeZarrLoader.ts` instead.)
 *
 * ```ts
 * const source = await fetchOmeZarr(url)
 * await nv.loadChunkedVolume(omeZarrChunkedSource(source, { channel: 1 }))
 * ```
 *
 * The time and channel axes are pinned per source (one channel streams per
 * chunked volume), and the declared spatial axis order is honoured: bricks
 * from an `x y z`-ordered store (the Human Organ Atlas) are transposed to the
 * x-fastest layout the contract requires, so the anatomy presents identically
 * to a conventional `z y x` store. See `docs/ome-zarr-format.md`.

 * A byte-bounded LRU cache for zarrita's `withByteCaching` store wrapper.

 * Values are raw store responses; an entry holding `undefined` is a CONFIRMED
 * ABSENCE (zarr's missing-chunk-means-fill-value convention), remembered so a
 * sparse store's absent chunks are not re-requested on every plan rebuild —
 * a store is immutable for the life of a load, so an absence is permanent.
 * Absences cost 0 bytes and are evicted like any other entry.
 *
 * `totalBytes <= maxBytes` holds after every operation: a value larger than
 * the whole budget is never admitted (its key is simply left uncached, and no
 * resident entries are evicted for it). A budget of 0 therefore caches only
 * zero-byte absence entries; `Infinity` never evicts.
 *
 * {@link stats} answers the question a byte budget always raises: is the
 * budget too small, or is there simply no reuse in this access pattern? The
 * two look identical from outside (both are all misses) and want opposite
 * fixes, so the counters distinguish them — a run with many evictions and few
 * hits is thrash, a run with few evictions and few hits has nothing to reuse.
 * `has` is the gate `withByteCaching` consults before every read, so it is the
 * one place a lookup is counted; `get` only runs after a hit.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const cache = new ByteLruCache(256 * 2 ** 20)
 * const store = zarr.withByteCaching(new zarr.FetchStore(url), { cache })
 * // ... stream ...
 * const { hits, misses, evicted } = cache.stats
