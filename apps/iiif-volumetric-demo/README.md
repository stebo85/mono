# iiif-volumetric-demo

Browser demo for the IIIF Volumetric Server, built on `@niivue/niivue`.

## Pages

- `index.html` — 3-pane IIIF Image API slices (axial / coronal / sagittal)
  plus a niivue 3D render driven by the Presentation 4.0 alpha manifest.
- `sheet.html` — 3×3 sheet of independent niivue instances on one
  zoomable canvas. Each cell loads a different IIIF volume from the
  server plus the same `.mz3` mesh (colored differently per cell).
  Drag to pan, wheel to zoom, +/−/fit buttons to step.
- `osd-volume-desktop.html` — OpenSeadragon-style deep-zoom 2D desktop
  of NIfTI tile previews fed from an IIIF VolumeDesktop manifest, with
  an embedded niivue 3D pane that loads the selected volume at the
  matching LOD.
- `omezarr.html` — multiscale streaming viewer with level selection,
  subvolume streaming, exploded block layout, and a WebGL2 / WebGPU
  backend toggle. Lists both OME-Zarr **and DICOM-WSI** volumes (the WSI
  streams as chunked RGB via niivue's RGB chunked-upload support). The
  default volume is `pawpawsaurus.ome.zarr` when present, otherwise the
  first streaming fixture returned by `/api`; open a specific one with
  `?id=...` (e.g. `?id=cptac-brca_dicom`).
- `range.html` — client-only chunk streaming proof-of-concept. It can
  load a static chunk-major `uint8` shard from Vite's public assets via
  `Range: bytes=start-end`, or fetch Pawpawsaurus OME-Zarr chunk objects
  directly in the browser with `zarrita` and feed the decoded bytes
  through the same `chunkSource` path as the OME-Zarr and WSI pages. See
  [client-only Zarr streaming notes](docs/client-only-zarr-streaming.md).
- `tile-range.html` — client-only tile streaming proof-of-concept. It
  loads a static multiscale RGBA tile pyramid from one packed binary
  shard, requests only visible tiles with HTTP `Range` headers, caches
  decoded bitmaps in the browser, and composites the result in a 2D
  canvas. It can also load a DICOM-WSI JSON frame directory from
  `/dicom-wsi/{id}/manifest.json`, then range-fetch and browser-decode
  the visible JPEG frames directly from the original `.dcm` files.
- `wsi.html` — DICOM whole-slide-imaging deep-zoom viewer. Renders a
  slide as a depth-1 RGB volume (2D axial = the slide face) with smooth,
  OpenSeadragon-style zoom/pan: scroll to zoom (cursor-anchored), drag to
  pan, a log-scaled zoom slider, a minimap with a viewport box and
  click-to-jump, and double-click-to-dive. An auto-LOD layer swaps the
  underlying pyramid window as you cross zoom levels (coarse levels load
  whole; finer levels load only the visible window via the server's bbox
  subvolume read), scale-matched so only the detail sharpens. Needs a
  `dicom-wsi` fixture — run
  `bunx nx run iiif-volumetric-server:fetch-dicom-wsi` and restart the
  server. See `packages/niivue/docs/dicom-wsi.md`.
- `microscopy.html` — the microscopy index. Groups the server's
  per-channel registry entries back into datasets (on the `dataset` key
  the `/api` listing exposes) and offers a dataset picker plus a channel
  list with a per-channel colormap. Selected channels load whole from
  `/volumes/{id}/raw.nii.gz` and stack as niivue overlays. Raw channels
  are windowed by percentile — these channels floor well above 0 (so the
  robust auto-window saturates) and the whole cell body sits above that
  floor as a structureless haze, which sums to an opaque brick across 16
  channels; keeping only the top few percent is what makes the stack
  read as separate structures. An Allen source also carries a segmentation
  per structure, named with a `_seg` suffix; those are label masks, not
  images, so they are thresholded just above their floor instead and, by
  default, reduced to their surface shell — a filled mask is opaque
  along any ray through it, so the nucleus would otherwise hide
  everything inside it at any alpha. The `both / raw / seg` filter picks
  which family the list shows, so `all` selects one whole family rather
  than the first 16 ids of the two together.
  Presentation follows the Allen IMSC reference viewer
  (`imsc.allencell.org/?page=3d-viewer`): 3D render on black by default
  with no crosshair or orient chrome, each recognised structure listed by
  gene symbol plus what it labels, and its own flat hue from that
  viewer's palette carried by a constant-colour/ramped-alpha colormap, so
  a structure reads as one colour instead of a gradient. `turntable`
  spins the render and `reset` returns the camera. `shading` applies
  matcap lighting from the local intensity gradient to every channel (not
  just the background volume), which is what gives the stack depth
  instead of the flat look of an unlit render; `max project` keeps the
  brightest sample along each ray instead of compositing front-to-back,
  matching the reference viewer's "Max project". The reference viewer
  path-traces; niivue single-pass raymarches, so even lit its render is
  crisper and less diffuse than the reference.
  Microscopy sources too large to load whole (the FIB-SEM OME-Zarr, the
  WSI slide) are listed in a sidebar with a link to the page that
  streams them. Needs a multi-channel fixture — run
  `bunx nx run iiif-volumetric-server:fetch-allen` and restart the
  server.
- `microscopy-overlay.html` — a synthesized hi-res microscopy patch
  placed inside an anatomical base volume with an *oblique* affine.
  Yaw/pitch sliders re-aim it in place via `setVolumeAffine`, and niivue
  reslices it onto the base grid — the point of the demo.

### Backend switching

Every niivue page reads a `?backend=webgl2|webgpu` URL query and
passes it to the `NiiVue` constructor (default: `webgl2`). The shared
nav ribbon exposes a `WebGL2 / WebGPU` toggle that reloads the page
with the new query; the WebGPU option is disabled when
`navigator.gpu` is absent. The choice is preserved across in-app
navigation.

## Running

The demo is a thin client; it needs the IIIF Volumetric Server running
on `http://127.0.0.1:8080` (default) with at least one volume fixture.
Run every command from the **repo root** unless noted.

Short version for the NIfTI demos:

```sh
bun install
git lfs install
git lfs pull
bunx nx build niivue
bunx nx run iiif-volumetric-server:fetch-fixtures
bunx nx dev iiif-volumetric-server
```

Then, in another terminal:

```sh
bunx nx dev iiif-volumetric-demo
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8087/index.html`.

`git lfs pull` is needed for pages that use `@niivue/dev-images`
assets, especially `sheet.html` and its mesh selector. Without it,
those files may be Git LFS pointer text instead of loadable volume or
mesh binaries.

### 1. Install dependencies (first time only)

```sh
bun install
```

### 2. Build `@niivue/niivue` (first time, and after any niivue change)

The demo imports `@niivue/niivue` (combined entry — both backends),
which resolves to a built file in `packages/niivue/dist/`. Vite does
**not** build workspace deps on the fly, so this must be done
explicitly:

```sh
bunx nx build niivue
```

> The built files are named `niivuegpu.js`, `niivuegpu.webgpu.js`,
> and `niivuegpu.webgl2.js` (the `niivuegpu` filename was kept from
> the upstream port). If Vite logs a missing-module error mentioning
> `niivuegpu.*.js`, this build step was skipped — it is not the
> legacy niivuegpu package.

### 3. Download fixture volumes (first time, or to add more)

This pulls a small set of T1w NIfTI files from OpenNeuro into
`apps/iiif-volumetric-server/fixtures/`. The default is 20 subjects from
dataset `ds000228`; already-present files are skipped.

```sh
bunx nx run iiif-volumetric-server:fetch-fixtures
```

To customise the dataset or count:

```sh
cd apps/iiif-volumetric-server
bun scripts/fetch-fixtures.ts --dataset=ds002336 --max=10
```

For the OME-Zarr page, fetch the default OME-Zarr fixture too:

```sh
bunx nx run iiif-volumetric-server:fetch-omezarr
```

The default OME-Zarr fetcher downloads only one coarse FIB-SEM pyramid
level so a fresh checkout stays quick. To fetch a larger level:

```sh
cd apps/iiif-volumetric-server
bun scripts/fetch-omezarr.ts --level=s3 --max-mb=4000
```

### 4. Start the IIIF server (terminal 1)

```sh
bunx nx dev iiif-volumetric-server
```

Listens on `http://127.0.0.1:8080`. Override with `PORT` / `HOST` /
`PUBLIC_BASE_URL` env vars. If the fixtures directory is empty the
server logs a warning and serves no volumes. The server will also
log `niivuegpu dist not found` — that warning belongs to a legacy
`/vendor/niivuegpu/*` route that no current page uses (the demos
now pull niivue from `@niivue/niivue` directly) and is safe to
ignore.

### 5. Start the demo (terminal 2)

```sh
bunx nx dev iiif-volumetric-demo
```

Vite serves on `http://127.0.0.1:8087` and opens `index.html`. It
proxies `/api`, `/iiif`, `/volumes`, `/zarr`, `/vendor`, and `/dev` to
the IIIF server. Point the proxy elsewhere with `IIIF_SERVER_URL`:

```sh
IIIF_SERVER_URL=http://127.0.0.1:9090 bunx nx dev iiif-volumetric-demo
```

The header on every page exposes the shared cross-page nav
(`volumes`, `sheet`, `osd desktop`, `omezarr`, `range`, `tiles`, `wsi`)
plus the `WebGL2 / WebGPU` backend toggle. `sheet.html` and
`osd-volume-desktop.html` both need the IIIF server running with at
least one fixture volume — `sheet.html` cycles available volumes
through 9 cells; `osd-volume-desktop.html` reads the VolumeDesktop
manifest at `/iiif/desktop/neuro/manifest`. `omezarr.html` needs at
least one OME-Zarr fixture; open
`http://127.0.0.1:8087/omezarr.html?id=fibsem-uint8.zarr` after the
default OME-Zarr fetch. `range.html` does not need the IIIF server for
the synthetic range shard, but the Pawpawsaurus OME-Zarr source needs
the server running so the browser can fetch
`/zarr/pawpawsaurus.ome.zarr/...` chunks.
`tile-range.html` also does not need the IIIF server for its synthetic
tile shard; Vite serves both the JSON tile index and packed tile bytes
as static assets. Its DICOM-WSI source needs the IIIF server running
with a DICOM WSI fixture so the browser can fetch
`/dicom-wsi/{id}/manifest.json` and range-read the referenced `.dcm`
files; for the default fixture open
`http://127.0.0.1:8087/tile-range.html?source=dicom-wsi&id=cptac-brca_dicom`.

> **Hidden pages** (source kept in the repo, but not in the nav or the
> production build — open directly during development):
>
> - `volume-fly-space.html` — WASD-fly through a constellation of NIfTI
>   volumes via niivue's `space: 'global3d'` instances. A retired
>   proof-of-concept for planning the subvolume streaming strategy.
> - `stitch.html` — standalone WebGL2 diagnostic for texture-stitching
>   boundary artifacts (NxN GPU textures as adjacent quads under a shear
>   matrix). Raw WebGL2, no niivue, no IIIF dependency.

### 6. Stop

`Ctrl-C` in each terminal. Fixtures persist; re-running step 3 is only
needed to add or refresh data.

## Troubleshooting

- **Vite error: failed to resolve `@niivue/niivue` / missing
  `niivuegpu.*.js`** — step 2 was skipped. Run `bunx nx build niivue`.
- **Blank viewer / 404s on `/iiif/...`** — the server isn't running, or
  is on a different port than `IIIF_SERVER_URL` expects.
- **Server starts but no volumes listed** — fixtures dir is empty; run
  step 3.
- **OME-Zarr page says no OME-Zarr volumes** — run
  `bunx nx run iiif-volumetric-server:fetch-omezarr`, restart the
  server, then reload `omezarr.html`.
- **WebGPU toggle disabled** — the browser doesn't expose
  `navigator.gpu`. Safari needs the feature flag enabled; older
  Firefox builds don't support it. WebGL2 is the default and works
  everywhere.
- **Port 8087 or 8080 already in use** — stop the other process, or
  override `PORT` (server) / pass `--port` to Vite (demo).
