# `@niivue/nv-ohif` — NiiVue viewport extension for OHIF

Design + delivery plan. Developed on `ohif-viewer-integration`, **merged to
main 2026-08-12 via PR #76** (merge 28da9cfc) after review by Taylor, whose
six review fixes (toolbar/ruler state, flashStatus timer, WSI ImageType
classification and ranking, imageIds fallback compaction, spline dblclick)
are included.

**Status: Phase 1 PROVEN — in a real OHIF app.** The extension + React-18 viewport +
NIfTI data bridge render a volume end-to-end. Independent proofs:
1. A proof harness (`demo/`, `bun run dev`) drives the real extension the way OHIF
   would — `getViewportModule()` -> `NiivueViewport` fed a mock OHIF `displaySets`
   prop pointing at a public NIfTI — and NiiVue renders it multiplanar (verified
   in-browser with MNI152).
2. A **full local OHIF Viewer app** (OHIF `master`/3.13-beta, pnpm 11, rsbuild dev
   on :3000) with `@niivue/nv-ohif` registered in `pluginConfig.json` and mode-basic's
   primary viewport routed to `@niivue/nv-ohif.viewportModule.niivue`. Loading a DICOM
   study at `/basic?StudyInstanceUIDs=...` mounts **our** NiiVue viewport (NiiVue's
   multiplanar chrome + crosshairs render; cornerstone is no longer the active
   viewport) and correctly shows the Phase-1 "DICOM support is coming" placeholder for
   a DICOM series (no NIfTI URL to load yet). No console errors. This confirms the
   extension/mode/SOPClassHandler plumbing works against a real OHIF build.

3. **NIfTI rendered in the full OHIF app (2026-07-14).** The OHIF public demo data
   source has no NIfTI display set, so we fed one the way a data source would:
   `window.services.displaySetService.addDisplaySets({ url: '<public .nii.gz>', … })`
   then `viewportGridService.setDisplaySetsForViewport({ viewportId, displaySetInstanceUIDs })`.
   OHIF mounted **our** NiiVue viewport and rendered MNI152 multiplanar + 3D, toolbar
   working over it. This is the real routing path end-to-end (display-set -> viewport
   component -> `displaySetToNiivue` -> `loadVolumes`); only the display set's *origin*
   is injected vs fetched, which is exactly what a data source does internally.
   **Routing gotcha:** the injected display set's `SOPClassHandlerId` MUST be one listed
   in a mode viewport's `displaySetsToDisplay`, or OHIF can't pick a viewport component
   and renders nothing (black, no canvas). mode-basic maps the default stack handler
   (`@ohif/extension-default.sopClassHandlerModule.stack`) to the niivue viewport, so use
   that id. (A consumer shipping NIfTI needs a data source / SOPClassHandler that emits
   such a display set — OHIF core here has zero NIfTI support: no nifti extension, data
   source, cornerstone loader, or URL param.)

**Real-app packaging gotcha (cost real time — do NOT repeat):** do NOT `ln -s` the
local monorepo `@niivue/niivue` into the OHIF app's `node_modules`. rspack follows the
symlink into *this* monorepo's `node_modules` and bundles a **duplicate** of shared
deps, which broke OHIF's own floating-ui with `TypeError: platform.detectOverflow is
not a function` (Route error boundary -> viewport never mounts, cornerstone shown
instead). Fix / correct consumption model: install **packed tarballs**
(`npm pack` niivue + nv-ohif, `pnpm add file:<unpacked-dir>`), so each resolves as a
self-contained package from the OHIF app's own tree — no cross-monorepo dep leakage.
Rewrite nv-ohif's `@niivue/niivue: workspace:*` peer to the concrete packed version
first. This is exactly the published-npm path consumers will use.

**Mode routing gotcha for testing:** OHIF's bundled default `/viewer` route is
**mode-longitudinal** (cornerstone), NOT mode-basic. mode-basic's `routeName` is
`basic`, so route the test viewport there and load `/basic?StudyInstanceUIDs=...`.

Lessons from the proof: (1) vite needed `resolve.dedupe: ['react','react-dom']` or
hooks threw "Invalid hook call" (two React copies); (2) load must wait for
`attachToCanvas` to resolve (a `ready` gate) or it races the GPU context; (3) default
to the **WebGL2** backend — WebGPU threw a `createBindGroup` error under the demo's
mount/unmount churn. All three are baked in.

## Upstream OHIF/Viewers PR — status 2026-08-12

The "PR into the OHIF/Viewers monorepo can follow once this is proven" from
the Goal below is now actionable: the extension is proven, reviewed and in
main. Remaining prerequisites, in order:

1. **Publish the packages.** `@niivue/nv-ohif` is not on npm (E404), nor is
   `@niivue/uikit` (made publishable 2026-07-28, ebc8ca0f); `@niivue/niivue`
   publishes as `1.0.0-rc.*` while npm `latest` is still the old 0.69.0 line.
   An upstream PR can only reference installable packages, so an `nx release`
   of nv-ohif + uikit (+ the niivue rc they peer on) comes first.
   **Runbook (uikit targeted shortly after the 2026-08-12 meeting):** the
   `release` GitHub workflow (manual dispatch, whole typescript group,
   independent versions from conventional commits) — run once with
   `dry_run=true` and review the version plan (uikit goes 0.0.0 -> first
   release; the train also picks up nv-ohif and the next niivue rc, which is
   wanted here), then re-run for real; `rc=true` publishes under the npm
   `next` tag instead. Publishing is `publish-npm-packages.ts` in the same
   workflow (or `publish-from-tags` re-runs it from tags). Verify with
   `npm view @niivue/uikit version`. The `workspace:*` peer substitution is
   the same mechanism prior nv-react/extension rc publishes used; the dry
   run shows the resolved ranges.
2. **Decide the PR shape.** Recommended: stay an EXTERNAL plugin, PRing
   OHIF's docs/plugin registry with the `pluginConfig.json` recipe and mode
   wiring (small, maintainable here); contributing the extension into the
   OHIF monorepo itself is the heavyweight alternative and transfers
   maintenance.
3. **First-impression polish that should ride along** (from the follow-up
   list): colormap picker and segmentation overlays; NVSlide-2D/WSI already
   ships (JPEG TILED_FULL, others declined with a note).
4. Re-verify the clean-consumer path (`npm pack` install into a stock OHIF
   app) against the PUBLISHED packages rather than local tarballs.

## Goal

Ship NiiVue as a **third-party OHIF viewport**, so OHIF users can render series with
NiiVue — bringing capabilities OHIF's default cornerstone viewport does not focus
on: high-quality **3D volume rendering**, **mesh / surface overlays**, **multiplanar
with colormapped overlays**, and **voxel drawing / vector annotation**. Neuroimaging
workflows in particular.

Decisions taken:
- **Submission path: standalone published npm extension** (added to an OHIF app via
  `pluginConfig.json`), developed here in the monorepo. Not (initially) a PR into the
  OHIF/Viewers monorepo — that can follow once this is proven.
- **Data path is phased**: NIfTI display sets first, DICOM second (details below).

## How OHIF loads a third-party viewport (the contract we must satisfy)

OHIF viewers are **extensions + a mode**, not standalone apps.

1. **Extension** — a plain object `{ id, version, getViewportModule(...) }`.
   `getViewportModule` returns `[{ name, component }]`; `component` is a React
   component. May also expose `onModeEnter` / `onModeExit` lifecycle hooks.
2. **Viewport component props** — `displaySets`, `viewportId`, `dataSource`,
   `servicesManager`, `extensionManager`, `commandsManager`, `viewportOptions`
   (orientation etc.), `children`. Should be memoized (`areEqual`) to control
   re-renders; honor `needsRerendering`.
3. **SOPClassHandlerModule** — declares which display sets this viewport handles
   (`displaySetsToDisplay` / SOP Class UIDs), so OHIF routes matching series here.
4. **Mode** — wires the extension + a layout template + panels, and maps display
   sets → the NiiVue viewport. We ship a demo mode; consumers can also add the
   viewport to their own mode.
5. **React 18** — OHIF pins `react@^18.3.1`. We target React 18 (see below).

## Package shape

```
packages/nv-ohif/
  src/
    index.ts                # the OHIF extension object (id, version, getViewportModule, lifecycle)
    getNiivueViewportModule.tsx
    NiivueViewport.tsx       # React 18 component: owns a <canvas> + a Niivue instance
    sopClassHandler.ts       # SOPClassHandlerModule — which displaySets we claim
    mode/                    # a demo OHIF mode that hangs series in the NiiVue viewport
    data/
      displaySetToNiivue.ts  # displaySet -> NiiVue load (the data bridge; phased)
      cornerstoneVolumeToNVImage.ts  # (phase 2) in-memory cornerstone volume -> NVImage
    commands.ts              # OHIF commands (reset view, set slice type, toggle 3D render, ...)
    toolbar.ts               # toolbar buttons wired to commands
  PLAN.md                    # this file
  README.md                  # consumer docs (add to pluginConfig, mode config)
  package.json / project.json / tsconfig.json
```

**Packaging / deps (learned during scaffold):** the published entry is `src/index.ts`
(the extension object — a real module, so Biome doesn't flag it as a barrel). We do
NOT declare `@ohif/*` (or `react-dom`) as peerDependencies: **bun installs peer deps**,
and pulling the OHIF tree drags in `react-dom@18`, which hoists and breaks
`@niivue/nvreact` (React 19) in this monorepo. Instead we build against **local OHIF
typings** (`src/ohif-types.ts`) and externalize `react`. The only deps are
`@niivue/niivue` (workspace) + a `react` peer of `^18.3.1 || ^19` (so bun reuses the
monorepo's React 19 for dev; the OHIF host supplies React 18 at runtime). The OHIF /
react-dom requirement is documented in `README.md`, not enforced via peers.

### Consumer packaging — verified end-to-end (2026-07-14)

Verified the real `npm pack` -> clean-install consumer path (not the dev rig's
hand-copied `.niivue-pkgs`). Findings:

1. **Publish with a workspace-aware packer (bun/pnpm), NOT `npm pack`/`npm publish`.**
   `npm pack` leaves `@niivue/niivue: "workspace:*"` verbatim in the published
   `package.json` -> a consumer's install errors (`Unsupported URL Type "workspace:"`).
   `bun pm pack` rewrites it to the concrete workspace version (`1.0.0-rc.10`). The Nx
   Release / publish flow MUST do this rewrite; confirm it does before publishing.
2. **The niivue peer resolves, but only under the `next` tag.** Published
   `@niivue/niivue`: `latest` = `0.69.0`, `next` = `1.0.0-rc.10`. bun rewrites the peer
   to the exact `1.0.0-rc.10` (published as `next`), so `npm install @niivue/nv-ohif`
   auto-installs niivue rc.10 — but a consumer who separately installs
   `@niivue/niivue@latest` gets 0.69.0 and mismatches. Document "use niivue >=1.0.0-rc.10
   (@next)"; consider emitting a range (`^1.0.0-rc.10`) rather than an exact pin at
   release.
3. **Clean install is self-contained and correct.** `npm install <bun-packed tgz>` in an
   empty project resolved: nv-ohif 0.0.0 + auto-installed peers niivue 1.0.0-rc.10 &
   react 19.2.7, dep dcmjs 0.49.4, and `@niivue/dcm2niix` **1.2.0**. react is
   externalized (not bundled). Tarball is dist-only (index.js + types + README), 18
   files, no monorepo/src leakage.
4. **API-compatible with the published niivue.** The packed nv-ohif imports only three
   niivue symbols — `NiiVueGPU` (default), `DRAG_MODE`, `SLICE_TYPE` — and published
   rc.10's `index.d.ts` exports all three (`export { DRAG_MODE, …, SLICE_TYPE }`,
   `export { default, default as NiiVueGPU }`). No monorepo-newer-API gap.
5. **DICOM confirmed broken for consumers** (as documented above): the resolved
   `@niivue/dcm2niix@1.2.0` worker still has the bare `const exitCode = mod.callMain(args)`
   (no exit fix), so browser conversion aborts. NIfTI is the consumer-supported path
   until the dcm2niix `DCM2NIIX_PIN` bump.

Not re-run live: a full in-OHIF render via published deps. It would add no new signal —
the OHIF demo data source is all DICOM (no NIfTI display set to exercise the working
path), DICOM fails on the known-broken dcm2niix, and rendering with rc.10-equivalent
niivue is already proven (NIfTI via the `demo/` harness, DICOM in the app). Finding #4
closes the only open compatibility question statically.

### React 18, not `nv-react`

`nv-react` pins React 19; OHIF is on React 18. NiiVue's core is framework-agnostic
(a canvas + the `Niivue` class), so `NiivueViewport.tsx` instantiates `Niivue`
directly (`new Niivue(opts)` → `attachToCanvas(ref)` → `loadVolumes(...)`), and
tears it down on unmount. We do **not** depend on `nv-react`. Shared logic (event
wiring, load diffing) can be factored later if worthwhile.

## Data bridge — the central work, phased

OHIF hands the viewport a **displaySet** (series metadata + image references), not a
NIfTI file. Getting pixels into NiiVue:

### Phase 1 — NIfTI display sets (MVP)
Handle display sets that reference a NIfTI (a NIfTI data source, or DICOM-JSON /
custom display set pointing at a `.nii.gz` URL). `NiivueViewport` calls
`nv.loadVolumes([{ url }])` directly. Proves the extension/mode/SOPClassHandler
plumbing and NiiVue's rendering inside OHIF end-to-end, with the least data work.

### Phase 2 — DICOM via cornerstone volume reuse (best UX)
OHIF/cornerstone3D already streams a DICOM series into an **in-memory volume**
(typed-array scalar data + image metadata: spacing, orientation, origin,
rescale). Build an `NVImage` from that already-loaded volume — **no re-fetch** —
by mapping cornerstone volume metadata → a NIfTI-like header + RAS affine. This is
the "good experience": one load, NiiVue renders it.
- Risk: getting the affine / axis orientation exactly right (DICOM LPS ↔ NIfTI RAS,
  row/column/slice direction cosines). Needs careful tests against known series.

### DICOM shippability — RESOLVED (was: blocked on an unpublished dcm2niix release)

**RESOLVED 2026-07-28 (commit a34799f5):** `@niivue/dcm2niix` `1.3.20260724`
published with the Web-Worker exit fix; the `DCM2NIIX_PIN` dep was bumped to
`^1.3.20260724`, so DICOM conversion works for npm-install consumers. The fix's
presence in the published tarball was independently re-verified 2026-08-12
(guarded `exitCode = mod.callMain(args)` + `err.status` recovery in both
workers). Follow-ups: the dev-rig `file:` override in
`~/Dev/ohif-viewers/.niivue-pkgs` and the twice-daily npm-watch routine
(`trig_01SpgkDT1MxP8VasinX5bQdi`) are both obsolete and can be retired.
The original finding, kept for history:

`DCM2NIIX_PIN` — **DICOM does not work for `npm`-install consumers yet.** The path
needs the dcm2niix Web-Worker exit fix (wrap `callMain` in try/catch, read
`err.status`; see the Phase-2 finding below). That fix is in **no published**
`@niivue/dcm2niix`: latest is `1.2.0` and there is a `1.3.0-dev.0` prerelease, and
**both still have the bare `const exitCode = mod.callMain(args)`** (verified by
fetching both tarballs). The monorepo dev rig only works because a locally-built
patched `1.3.0` is hand-installed into the OHIF app's `.niivue-pkgs`.

Maintainer (Chris) has confirmed he will land the suggested changes upstream.
**Action when a fixed release publishes:** bump `packages/nv-ohif/package.json`
`@niivue/dcm2niix` from `^1.2.0` to `>=<fixed version>` (marker `DCM2NIIX_PIN` is on
that dep + in the README `## DICOM support`), then re-verify the clean-consumer
`npm pack` path. Until then, NIfTI is the consumer-supported path; DICOM is
dev-rig-only.

**Interim: use a local patched dcm2niix (decided 2026-07-14).** DICOM stays working
in the dev rig / demos on a locally-built patched copy until the upstream release:
- **Patch source of truth:** `~/Dev/dcm2niix-src`, branch `fix/worker-exit-status`,
  commit `4150f31` ("fix(js): read output when callMain unwinds via exit() in a Web
  Worker"). The change is pure JS glue (`js/src/worker*.js`) — the WASM is unchanged,
  so no WASM rebuild is needed; the patched package = the published files with the
  fixed `worker.jpeg.js`/`worker.js`.
- **Built patched package:** `~/Dev/ohif-viewers/.niivue-pkgs/dcm2niix` (`1.3.0`, has
  the fix — `let exitCode = 0;` + `err.status` recovery). Durable (survives npm
  installs); the OHIF dev app depends on it via
  `@niivue/dcm2niix: file:../../.niivue-pkgs/dcm2niix` in `platform/app/package.json`.
- **Scope:** dev-rig override only. `packages/nv-ohif/package.json` intentionally keeps
  the published range `^1.2.0` (with `DCM2NIIX_PIN`) — a `file:` dep must never be
  published. The monorepo's own build/tests never load dcm2niix (it is externalized
  and stubbed in tests), so the local copy matters only where DICOM actually runs.
- **Monitoring:** a twice-daily cloud routine (`0 13,21 * * *` UTC ≈ 09:00/17:00 ET,
  id `trig_01SpgkDT1MxP8VasinX5bQdi`, https://claude.ai/code/routines/trig_01SpgkDT1MxP8VasinX5bQdi)
  checks npm for a published `@niivue/dcm2niix` containing the fix and reports the pin
  bump when it lands.

### Phase 2 status — reconstruction bridge DONE + proven end-to-end (2026-07-13)

The DICOM->NIfTI path is implemented and **proven correct end-to-end at full scale**
with the real `@niivue/dcm2niix` WASM (the `.jpeg` build has CharLS/OpenJPEG). Running
the raw Emscripten module in bun on the OHIF demo's CTA series: reconstruct 295
JPEG-LS instances -> encapsulated P10s -> dcm2niix -> `Convert 295 DICOM (512x512x295)`,
exit 0, valid NIfTI. 25 unit tests cover the pure logic incl. a dcmjs P10 round-trip.

Reconstruction gotchas found + fixed (all in `reconstructP10.ts`, all tested):
1. dcmjs strict VR length on non-conformant multi-value CS -> `allowInvalidVRLength`.
2. Elements without a `Value` (InlineBinary/BulkDataURI), incl. nested in sequences,
   crash dcmjs' binary writer -> recursive `sanitizeDataset` drops them.
3. Elements missing `vr` (e.g. AvailableTransferSyntaxUID) -> dcmjs treats as UN and
   throws -> drop them.
4. The demo server serves **JPEG-LS** frames (static store, no transcode); declare the
   real transfer syntax + write PixelData **encapsulated** (OB) not native.
5. dcmjs splits frames into 20 KB fragments; dcm2niix only decodes single-fragment
   frames -> `fragmentMultiframe: false`.

**In-app blocker ROOT-CAUSED + FIX PROVEN (in the dependency, not our code).** The
`@niivue/dcm2niix` Web **Worker** failed for every in-browser conversion. Root cause:
Emscripten's `exit()` RETURNS the code under Node (so the bun proof passes) but THROWS
in a Web Worker; `worker.jpeg.js` does `const exitCode = mod.callMain(args)` and lets
that throw hit its catch, so it never reads `/output`. **Fix** (source is
`rordenlab/dcm2niix/js/src/worker.jpeg.js` + `worker.js`): wrap `callMain` in
try/catch, use `err.status` on a thrown ExitStatus, then read `/output`. **Proven**:
with the patched worker, our reconstructed JPEG-LS files convert in the real browser
worker — 12-slice CTA -> a valid `vol.nii` (6,291,808 B = 512x512x12x2 + 352). Verified
by driving the actual `niivue-dcm2niix` demo (`~/Dev/niivue-dcm2niix`) with our
reconstructed files (staged in `public/recon/` + `test-recon.html`). Patch saved to the
session scratchpad as `dcm2niix-worker-exit-fix.patch`; upstream fix belongs in
`@niivue/dcm2niix` (a published release then flows to every consumer, incl. this
extension unchanged).

**CORRECTION (2026-07-13): the "CharLS abort under webpack" was OUR bug, not dcm2niix.**
The apparent CharLS/JPEG-LS abort and the scrambled uncompressed render had one root
cause: `parseMultipartRelated` returned the whole multipart buffer (headers included) as
pixel data whenever the browser exposed the frame response Content-Type as bare
`multipart/related` with the boundary stripped (which browsers commonly do). That
prepended ~127 header bytes and byte-shifted every 16-bit voxel; for JPEG-LS it also
corrupted the JLS codestream so CharLS threw. Fixed by recovering the boundary from the
body's opening `--<boundary>` line (commit `3dce44f4`). **After the fix, BOTH uncompressed
AND JPEG-LS DICOM reconstruct and render pixel-faithfully in the real OHIF app
(webpack).** So webpack/rspack bundle the dcm2niix worker + WASM fine; there is no
bundler issue. The dcm2niix worker-exit fix is still required and correct (verified
independently). The CharLS follow-up note to Chris should NOT be sent.

---
(Superseded investigation below, kept for history.)

**SECOND, DEEPER BLOCKER (dcm2niix WASM x modern bundlers).** With the exit fix applied,
the DICOM path was tested in the REAL OHIF app (webpack/rspack). dcm2niix's WASM inits,
finds the files, prints its banner + "Image Decompression is new", then **aborts inside
CharLS JPEG-LS decompression** by throwing a bare pointer (an escaping C++ exception).
Confirmed by capturing the worker's `printErr` in-app. Key facts that localize it:
- Not our code / not the files: the SAME reconstructed bytes decode fine under Node
  (bun, 295 slices) and under **Vite 5** (the `niivue-dcm2niix` demo), and native
  dcm2niix parses the P10s.
- Not memory: 8 slices aborts identically to 295.
- Not WASM corruption: OHIF serves `.wasm` as `asset/resource` (byte-identical) and it
  runs far enough to enumerate all files before the decode step.
- Not Babel: OHIF dev excludes node_modules from transpilation.
- Pattern: works under Node + Vite 5; aborts under webpack/rspack AND Vite 8. So newer
  bundlers break the Emscripten C++ exception path in the CharLS (`.jpeg`) build.

This is a dcm2niix-WASM-vs-modern-bundler issue (Emscripten exception handling in a Web
Worker under webpack/Vite-8), not nv-ohif. It belongs with the dcm2niix maintainer
alongside the worker-exit fix.

**DICOM RENDERS IN THE REAL OHIF APP (uncompressed path, 2026-07-13).** Since CharLS is
the only broken path, an UNCOMPRESSED DICOM study skips it. Loaded an uncompressed CT
(NECK/AXA, 100 slices, Explicit VR LE) in the OHIF app: reconstruct P10 -> dcm2niix ->
NIfTI -> **NiiVue renders it multiplanar + 3D in OHIF**, no errors. Volume verified
faithful: 512x512x100, INT16, spacing 0.9375x0.9375x3.06mm, RescaleIntercept -1000 (HU).
So the whole pipeline works end-to-end in OHIF (webpack) for uncompressed DICOM; only
compressed (CharLS/JPEG-LS) is blocked pending the dcm2niix bundler fix.

Follow-up polish: our viewport does not set a window/level (NiiVue's cal_min/max came up
undefined, so CT renders unwindowed/noisy). Add a sensible default window after load (or
bridge OHIF's W/L). Manually setting cal_min=-160/cal_max=240 confirmed a proper CT view.

Note: nv-ohif's OWN Vite-8 demo (`?dicom`) also hits this. The `niivue-dcm2niix` demo
runs Vite 5 and works. Reconstructed files are byte-valid (magic `DICM`, correct size).

### Phase 2 (implemented) — `dcm2niix` via WADO-RS / reconstruction
`dicomToNiivue.ts` fetches each instance's **original DICOM P10** from the DICOMweb
data source (WADO-RS retrieve-instance, `Accept: multipart/related;
type="application/dicom"`), then converts with `@niivue/dcm2niix` (WASM). dcm2niix
owns the DICOM→NIfTI orientation/affine, so we don't hand-roll LPS→RAS. Pure parts
(`dicomWadoRs.ts` URL derivation + multipart parsing) and the router
(`classifyDisplaySet.ts`) are unit-tested. The viewport routes CT/MR to this path,
SM (whole-slide) toward NVSlide, NIfTI-URL to the direct path.

**Live-app finding (2026-07-13):** this path needs a DICOMweb server that supports
**RetrieveInstance** (full P10). The OHIF public demo data source is a **static
S3/CloudFront store**: it serves `/metadata` (200) and `/frames/N` (200) but returns
**403** for `/instances/{sop}` (no server to assemble a P10). So dcm2niix works
against real PACS (Orthanc, dcm4chee, Google Healthcare) but NOT static demo servers.
Two ways to also cover static servers (both universal, no RetrieveInstance needed):
- **P10 reconstruction** — fetch `/metadata` (dicom+json) + `/frames` bulkdata and
  assemble a DICOM P10 in-browser (e.g. with `dcmjs`, which OHIF bundles), then feed
  dcm2niix. Keeps dcm2niix; moderate work.
- **cornerstone in-memory volume bridge** — build the NIfTI directly from
  cornerstone's already-decoded volume (`createNiftiArray` + a hand-built LPS→RAS
  affine). Universal + no re-fetch (best UX), but we own the affine (needs tests).

**Webpack consumer note:** dcm2niix's Emscripten glue references Node builtins
(`module`/`url`/`fs`/`path`) inside dead `ENVIRONMENT_IS_NODE` branches; a webpack
host must set `resolve.fallback: { module:false, url:false, fs:false, path:false }`.

### Phase 3 — `dcm2niix` fallback (self-contained)
For series cornerstone hasn't volume-loaded, fetch instances via `dataSource` and
convert DICOM→NIfTI in-browser with `@niivue/dcm2niix` (already a NiiVue plugin).
Heavier (re-fetch + convert); a fallback, not the default.

## Surfacing NiiVue's value (the "good experience")

Wire OHIF toolbar buttons/commands to NiiVue features so an OHIF user actually gets
the differentiators:
- Slice type: axial / coronal / sagittal / **multiplanar** / **3D render**. **DONE**
- Reset view (camera / pan / zoom / crosshair). **DONE**
- **3D volume rendering** clip plane (off + 6 anatomical presets). **DONE**
  (exploded-block / drawing still to come.)
- **Overlays** (load the study's next series as a colormapped overlay). **DONE**
  (segmentation-specific overlays + colormap/opacity UI still to come.)
- **Mesh / surface** overlay on the volume.
- Window/level: OHIF's modality presets (+ robust auto) -> `calMin`/`calMax`, and
  the reverse (NiiVue contrast drag -> same-series siblings via
  `setViewportWindowLevel`). **DONE**
- Colormap: a base-volume colormap dropdown (gray / hot / bone / cool / warm /
  viridis / plasma / inferno / turbo / jet), a colorbar (legend) toggle, and a
  smoothing toggle (nearest-neighbor vs linear interpolation). **DONE**
  (per-overlay colormap + opacity UI still to come.)
- Sync: crosshair / camera sync with other OHIF viewports where it makes sense.
- Respect OHIF's active tool, measurement, and layout where feasible.
  (Primary-tool mirroring onto NiiVue left-drag: DONE for Window/Level + Pan.)

### Toolbar/commands status (2026-07-14) — LANDED + verified in the real app

The extension now exposes the full OHIF module set for toolbar integration:
- `commands.ts` — `getCommandsModule` (context `NIIVUE`): `niivueSetSliceType`
  (`{ sliceType: 'axial'|'coronal'|'sagittal'|'multiplanar'|'render' }`),
  `niivueResetView` (restores NiiVue `SCENE_DEFAULTS`: azimuth/elevation, zoom,
  2D + render pan, crosshair), `niivueSetClipPlane`
  (`{ plane: 'none'|'anterior'|'posterior'|'left'|'right'|'superior'|'inferior' }`
  -> `nv.setClipPlane([depth,azimuth,elevation])`; 'none' = depth 2 = disabled),
  and `niivueToggleOverlay` (loads the study's next loadable series — via the same
  direct-URL / dcm2niix path as the base — as a warm-colormapped 0.5-opacity
  overlay through `nv.addVolume`, or removes overlays if any are loaded).
- `toolbar.ts` — button defs (a `NiivueViews` dropdown, a `NiivueClip` dropdown,
  a `NiivueOverlay` toggle, and `NiivueReset`), section membership, and a
  customization pack (`niivue.toolbarButtons` / `niivue.toolbarSections`)
  auto-registered at default scope via `getCustomizationModule` -> entry named
  `default`. `getToolbarModule` registers `evaluate.niivue` /
  `evaluate.niivue.sliceType` / `evaluate.niivue.clipPlane` /
  `evaluate.niivue.overlay` / `evaluate.niivue.windowLevelPreset` evaluators
  (disable on non-NiiVue viewports; `isActive` tracks `nv.sliceType`, the current
  clip preset, and whether overlays are loaded; the W/L-preset evaluator disables
  presets whose modality does not match the base series).
- **Window/level bridge**: `niivueSetWindowLevel` ({window, level} -> calMin/calMax
  via setVolume(0)), `niivueSetWindowLevelPreset` (resolves OHIF's
  `cornerstone.windowLevelPresets` by the base modality — id then index, OHIF's own
  order — with a built-in fallback table; zero-width PT/SUV presets map to 0..level),
  and `niivueAutoWindowLevel` (recalculateCalMinMax(0), robust 2-98%). Toolbar
  `NiivueWindowLevel` dropdown: Auto + 5 CT presets + 3 PT presets, each preset
  modality-gated.
- **Reverse W/L bridge**: NiiVue emits no intensity event (parity doc confirms), so
  the viewport reads the base volume's calMin/calMax on canvas `pointerup`
  (`syncNiivueWindowLevelToOhif`); a change vs the entry's last window/level (seeded
  from the initial load, updated by the forward commands) is recorded on the entry,
  shown as a transient "W: .. L: .." readout, and reflected onto any OTHER OHIF
  viewport showing the same series (a cornerstone sibling in a multi-viewport
  layout). Each sibling is targeted by id via
  `commandsManager.runCommand('setViewportWindowLevel', { viewportId, windowWidth,
  windowCenter })`, which no-ops on a viewport cornerstone does not own. NOTE: do
  NOT use the `setWindowLevel` command for this — it targets the *active* viewport
  (ours) and throws on our non-cornerstone element (an earlier version did, and
  logged a caught warning on every drag). Unchanged releases (crosshair navigation)
  are silent.
- `niivueRegistry.ts` — viewportId -> **entry** map (nv instance + base
  displaySets + overlayUIDs + clip preset + windowLevel + a status sink). The
  viewport registers on attach and keeps displaySets/status current;
  commands/evaluators resolve the active viewport's entry through it (fallback: the
  sole registered entry). Overlay progress surfaces through the viewport's status
  overlay. `ohifCommandsManager()` reads the commandsManager from the prop or
  `window.commandsManager`.

Verified live: clip presets slice the 3D render (purple clip face); overlay toggle
loads the 900-instance PERFUSION series as a warm overlay across all planes and
removes it on re-toggle (UPENN-GBM). W/L: on the MR study only Auto is enabled and
CT/PT presets gray out; on a CT neck study Auto + the 5 CT presets enable (PT stays
disabled) and "Bone" re-windows the volume to a crisp bone window (2026-07-14). A
gotcha: the W/L-preset buttons evaluate before the load effect knows the base
modality, so the load effect now calls `refreshToolbar` after setting displaySets.
56 unit tests pass.

Mode wiring (done in the local app's mode-basic; consumers do the same):
```js
toolbarButtons:  [{ $reference: 'cornerstone.toolbarButtons' },
                  { $reference: 'niivue.toolbarButtons' }],
toolbarSections: [{ $reference: 'cornerstone.toolbarSections' },
                  { $reference: 'niivue.toolbarSections' },
                  { primary: [/* cornerstone ids..., */ 'NiivueViews', 'NiivueReset'] }],
```
(The literal `primary` restates the full list — section objects shallow-merge per
key, later wins.)

Two gotchas found live (both fixed in `NiivueViewport.tsx`):
1. **Toolbar evaluates before the async attach registers the instance**, leaving
   the buttons disabled. Fix: call `toolbarService.refreshToolbarState({ viewportId })`
   after register/unregister.
2. **OHIF re-renders the viewport with fresh `displaySets`/`servicesManager`
   object identities on toolbar interactions.** Keying effects on those
   identities re-ran the load effect and re-fetched the entire series (observed:
   a full 3720-instance DTI refetch on a toolbar click). Fix: effects key on a
   `displaySetsKey` (joined display-set UIDs) and read the latest props from
   refs; the create effect keys on `viewportId` only.

Verified in the browser (UPENN-GBM DTI, 3720 instances): dropdown switches all
five views, active state follows, reset restores the default camera after a
rotate, no re-fetch on toolbar interaction, no console errors from nv-ohif.

## Testing / verification

- Unit-test the pure bridge (`cornerstoneVolumeToNVImage`, affine mapping) with the
  Bun runner — this is where correctness bugs will live.
- The viewport/rendering is verified in a running OHIF app (the demo mode) — mirrors
  the repo convention that rendering is verified in a real app, not unit tests.
- Add the extension to a local OHIF dev build (`pluginConfig.json`) and drive it in
  the browser; screenshot the NiiVue viewport rendering a known series.

## TODO — NVSlide for 2D / whole-slide file types (NOT yet supported)

Status: **not implemented.** `classifyDisplaySet` already routes DICOM whole-slide
microscopy (`Modality: 'SM'`) to the `'wsi'` kind, and `NiivueViewport` shows a
placeholder note for it ("will render with NiiVue NVSlide (tiled) — that data path
is coming"). Nothing actually renders 2D/WSI yet.

What "support 2D file types via NVSlide" needs:
- **A DICOM-WSI tile source.** NVSlide expects a tiled, multi-resolution (LOD)
  source; OHIF hands us a DICOM SM display set (a pyramid of frames addressed by
  WADO-RS `/frames/{n}` per level). Write an adapter that exposes OHIF's SM display
  set (per-level tile grid + frame URLs, read from the instance metadata) as an
  NVSlide tile source, fetching tiles on demand (auth headers via the same
  `authHeaders(servicesManager)` path). Reuse the NVSlide WSI demo's tile-source
  shape (see the `poc-client-only-range-requests` branch / NVSlide plan).
- **Plain 2D images too** (non-DICOM: PNG/JPEG/TIFF display sets, and single-frame
  DICOM that is really a 2D picture). Decide: a NIfTI-style single-slice load into
  the existing volume path vs. an NVSlide 2D path. Small 2D can likely go straight
  through `loadVolumes` as a 1-slice volume; large/tiled 2D needs NVSlide.
- **Viewport routing.** `NiivueViewport` currently hard-stops on `kind === 'wsi'`
  with the placeholder; replace that branch with the NVSlide mount + tile-source
  wiring. Keep the volume path untouched.
- **SOPClassHandler.** Claim the VL Whole Slide Microscopy Image SOP class (and any
  2D SOP classes we want to own) so OHIF routes those series to this viewport.
- **Toolbar.** The slice-type / clip / overlay / W-L dropdowns are volume-centric;
  gate or adapt them for a 2D/WSI viewport (e.g. pan/zoom + a level selector).
- **Verify** against a real DICOM-WSI study (the study list has SM studies, e.g.
  "Histopathology" C3L-00088) and a plain 2D image.

Cross-refs: NVSlide plan + the WSI demo already prove NVSlide tiled rendering with
both backends; this task is the OHIF-display-set -> NVSlide-tile-source bridge.

### Design / scoping (2026-07-15) — grounded in the NVSlide API

NVSlide API surfaced (packages/niivue/src/slide/):
- **`SlideTileSource`** is the pluggable seam: `{ readonly manifest: NVSlideManifest;
  bind(host); fetchTileBytes(level, tile, label): Promise<Uint8Array> }`. NVSlide owns
  decoding (per `level.codec`), the LOD tile cache, telemetry, and the viewport; a
  source only supplies the pyramid manifest + encoded tile bytes.
- **`NVSlideManifest`**: `{ format?, width, height, tileSize?, levels: NVSlideLevelManifest[] }`.
  **`NVSlideLevelManifest`**: `{ downsample, columns, rows, codec?, dims }` where
  `codec ∈ 'raw-rgba' | 'image/jpeg' | 'image/jp2'`.
- **Construct**: `NVSlide.fromSource(source, options)` (or `fromManifestUrl`).
- **Two render paths (important):**
  1. **Standalone 2D** (what a WSI display set needs): NVSlide + a dedicated
     `SlideRenderer` (WebGL2) / `SlideRendererGPU` (WebGPU) driving the canvas, with
     NVSlide's own pan/zoom viewport. This is the `examples/slides.js` path and does
     NOT use the volume `Niivue` controller.
  2. **Slide-on-a-volume-plane**: `nv.setSlidePlane(slide, { pixelToWorld })` renders
     the slide into a volume's world (mm). This is `examples/slide3d.js`; not what a
     standalone WSI needs.
- **Codecs**: JPEG WSI -> `image/jpeg` decodes natively in-browser. JPEG-2000 WSI ->
  `image/jp2` needs `NVSlide.registerTileDecoder('image/jp2', decodeJp2)` with an
  OpenJPEG WASM decoder (heavy) -> defer; v1 handles JPEG-transfer-syntax WSI only.
- **The existing DICOM-WSI demo is OFFLINE-PREBUILT**: `scripts/fetch-dicom-wsi.ts`
  downloads a series and repackages it into a `dicom-wsi-range-v1` byte-range manifest
  (`ManifestRangeSource`). That does NOT apply to OHIF (live DICOMweb) — we need a NEW
  live source that fetches tiles on demand.

**Plan (v1 = DICOM-WSI, JPEG, standalone):**
1. **`DicomWsiTileSource implements SlideTileSource`** (new file). `manifest` built from
   the OHIF SM display set metadata (one pyramid level per WSI instance / per
   TotalPixelMatrix level: `columns/rows` = ceil(TotalPixelMatrixColumns/Rows / tile
   Columns/Rows), `tileSize` = tile Columns/Rows, `codec` from the transfer syntax).
   `fetchTileBytes(level, tile)` -> frame number = row-major index of (tile.col,
   tile.row) within the level, fetched via WADO-RS `/frames/{n}` (reuse
   `dicomWadoRs.ts` multipart parsing + `authHeaders(servicesManager)`), returning the
   encoded frame bytes. On-demand, no pre-download.
2. **Viewport routing**: replace the `kind === 'wsi'` placeholder in `NiivueViewport`
   with a standalone-slide mount — instantiate `SlideRenderer` on the canvas +
   `NVSlide.fromSource(new DicomWsiTileSource(ds, ...))`. Keep the volume path
   (`Niivue` controller) untouched; a WSI viewport is a *different* render object on
   the same `<canvas>`.
3. **Registry/toolbar**: a WSI viewport has no `Niivue` volume controller, so
   `getActiveNiivue` returns nothing and the volume toolbar (views/clip/W-L/colormap/
   colorbar/smoothing/overlay) correctly disables. Add a small slide toolbar later
   (reset-zoom, level indicator) if wanted; v1 relies on NVSlide's built-in pan/zoom.
4. **SOPClassHandler**: claim the VL Whole Slide Microscopy Image SOP class so OHIF
   routes SM series here (or keep using the mode's stack/wsi routing).

**De-risking probe — RESOLVED (2026-07-15).** Inspected a real SM study in the OHIF app
(C3L-00088, StudyInstanceUIDs=2.25.141277760791347900862109212450152067508):
- **SM display-set shape**: `Modality:'SM'`, handled by
  `@ohif/extension-cornerstone.sopClassHandlerModule.DicomMicroscopySopClassHandler`.
  `instances[]` is ONE entry PER PYRAMID LEVEL (6 here), each with
  `TotalPixelMatrixColumns/Rows` (level pixel dims), `Columns/Rows` (tile size, 240x240
  on the tiled levels), `NumberOfFrames` (= tileCols x tileRows, verified: finest level
  35855x36162 -> ceil(35855/240)=150 x ceil(36162/240)=151 = 22650 frames; level 4
  38x38=1444; level 5 10x10=100), `SamplesPerPixel:3`, `PhotometricInterpretation:'RGB'`.
  `imageIds[]` is per-instance (one base `wadors:.../instances/{sop}/frames/1` per level);
  a tile fetch swaps `/frames/1` -> `/frames/{N}`, N = row*tileCols + col + 1 (row-major).
  NOTE: levels are NOT sorted, and 3 of the 6 are small single-tile overview/label/macro
  images (666x716, 761x768, 1600x629 with NumberOfFrames=1) — the manifest builder must
  keep the real pyramid (multi-tile VOLUME levels), sort by resolution, and derive
  `downsample = finestWidth / levelWidth`. (Filter by DICOM `ImageType` VOLUME vs
  LABEL/OVERVIEW/THUMBNAIL.)
- **Transfer syntax = `1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.50` (JPEG Baseline)** -> codec `image/jpeg`,
  native browser decode. Matches the JPEG-only v1 scope.
- **The static CloudFront demo store SERVES WSI tiles on demand**: fetched `/frames/1`
  and a mid-pyramid `/frames/11325` -> both HTTP 200, `multipart/related`, ~3-4 KB, JPEG
  SOI (FF D8) at offset 116. WSI needs ONLY `/frames` (not `/instances`), so it works on
  the static store where the volume-reconstruction path 403'd. Our `dicomWadoRs.ts`
  multipart parsing (with the boundary-recovery fix) handles the frame body directly.

So the manifest mapping and data path are fully determined; implementation is mechanical.

**Remaining open items (impl details, low risk):**
- The `<canvas>` lifecycle: NiivueViewport currently assumes one `Niivue` per canvas;
  the WSI branch swaps in a `SlideRenderer` instead — make create/teardown handle both.
- JP2 transfer-syntax WSI (defer; needs the OpenJPEG decoder). v1 is JPEG-only.
- Exclude LABEL/OVERVIEW/THUMBNAIL instances from the pyramid (keep VOLUME levels).

**Plain 2D (PNG/JPEG/single-frame):** separate, smaller follow-up — a small
single-frame image can load through the existing volume path (`loadVolumes` as a
1-slice volume); only large/tiled 2D needs the NVSlide path above. Not part of v1.

## Open items / decisions still to make

- Which OHIF version to target first (pin to a recent `3.x`; confirm the exact
  `@ohif/core` API surface for `getViewportModule` + SOPClassHandler in that release).
- Exact display-set criteria we claim in the SOPClassHandler (start narrow:
  a NIfTI/volume display set; expand to DICOM SOP classes in phase 2).
- How much of OHIF's tool/measurement model to honor vs. NiiVue's own interactions.
- Monorepo build: OHIF uses webpack/React 18; our packages are Bun/Nx. The extension
  is a library build (externalize react + @ohif/*), consumed by the OHIF app's build.

## Future possibility — export NiiVue masks as DICOM SEG

Raised as feedback after the 2026-07-29 demo: let a NiiVue segmentation/mask
produced in the viewport round-trip back into the clinical workflow as a **DICOM
Segmentation (SEG)** object, so it can be stored in PACS and re-read by OHIF's
own `@ohif/extension-cornerstone-dicom-seg` (or any DICOM-SEG-aware viewer).

Not scheduled — captured here so it is not lost. Sketch of the shape:

- **Source mask.** NiiVue already has voxel masks: the drawing tool
  (`model.drawingVolume`, a `Uint8Array` label map on the background grid) and
  loaded/derived segmentation overlays. Either is the export input.
- **Writer.** Reuse **`dcmjs`** (already a runtime dep for the DICOM read path).
  `dcmjs` has a DICOM-SEG writer (the Cornerstone adapter / `Segmentation`
  derivation) that emits a multi-frame SEG referencing the source instances.
  Feeding it our mask avoids hand-rolling the IOD.
- **Geometry mapping — the real work.** The mask is in NiiVue RAS voxel space; a
  SEG stores per-frame binary (or fractional) segments aligned to the **source
  DICOM series** in LPS, one frame per referenced instance, with
  `PerFrameFunctionalGroups` (ReferencedInstance, image position/orientation).
  So we must resample/relabel the RAS mask back onto the original slice geometry
  — the inverse of the `dcm2niix` LPS→RAS bridge we already do on load. Reusing
  the source series' `imageIds` + cornerstone metadata (as the WSI/DICOM paths do)
  gives the per-frame references.
- **Segment metadata.** SegmentSequence needs a label, recommended display color
  (map from the NiiVue label LUT), algorithm type (`MANUAL`), and category/type
  codes (SNOMED). Multi-label draws → multiple segments.
- **Delivery.** A toolbar command (e.g. "Export SEG") that either downloads the
  `.dcm` or hands the dataset to OHIF's STOW-RS / the app's data source, mirroring
  the existing capture/save flow.
- **Reverse (bonus).** Loading a DICOM SEG *into* NiiVue (SEG → RAS label map as
  a colormapped overlay) would complete the round-trip and reuse the overlay path
  already built for the Overlay toggle.

Challenges to size before committing: exact RAS↔source-geometry resample
(non-axial/oblique source series, gantry tilt), fractional vs binary SEG, and
keeping it out of the runtime bundle unless a consumer opts in (SEG writing pulls
more of `dcmjs`). Related: the annotation measurements already reflect into OHIF's
MeasurementService, and OHIF can already export those as DICOM SR — SEG would do
the same for the raster masks.

## Non-goals (for v1)

- Replacing cornerstone as OHIF's default viewport.
- Full measurement/segmentation parity with cornerstone tools.
- Oblique/arbitrary-plane reformatting beyond what NiiVue already does.
