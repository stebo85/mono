/**
 * A pool of workers that read OME-Zarr chunks, so fetch and decode stop
 * competing with the render loop.
 *
 * Stage B measured the problem (`docs/caching.md` 2.5): 20 seconds of
 * uninteracted streaming cost the render loop 8.6 seconds over a 24 ms frame
 * budget, of which only 125 ms was texture upload. Everything else was the
 * store read and the decode inside zarrita, and all of it ran on the thread
 * that draws. This pool moves that work; the upload and the gradient pass stay
 * where they must be, next to the GPU context.
 *
 * Each worker opens the store itself and keeps its own byte LRU, so a request
 * is routed by hashing its region rather than by picking the idlest worker --
 * see {@link routeChunkToWorker} for why that matters.
 *
 * A worker failure is not automatically fatal: the caller still holds a
 * main-thread source and can read there. Only failures a re-run would repeat
 * (a missing store, a region that will not decode) come back marked final.
