/**
 * Replace a label mask with its surface shell.
 *
 * A mask is a filled solid, and a filled solid is opaque along any ray that
 * crosses it — so in the 3D render the largest structure (the nucleus of
 * `DNA_seg`) hides everything inside it no matter how far its alpha is turned
 * down. Alpha only controls how fast a ray saturates, not whether it does.
 *
 * Keeping only the labelled voxels that touch an unlabelled 6-neighbour turns
 * each mask into an outline in the 2D slices and a hollow shell in the 3D
 * render, which is what makes a whole segmentation stack legible at once.
 *
 * `floor` is the background level (`globalMin`), which the interior is reset to
 * rather than to zero: the display windows above the floor, so the emptied
 * interior has to land on it to read as background. `globalMin` / `globalMax`
 * are unchanged by this, since the shell keeps both extremes.
 *
 * Returns a NEW array rather than editing in place. Both backends cache the
 * uploaded source texture against `img.buffer` identity
 * (`prepareOrientTextureCache`), so an in-place edit is invisible to the GPU —
 * the cache reuses the texture it already has and nothing on screen changes.
