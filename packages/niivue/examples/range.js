// zarrita). Add `?backend=webgpu` to the URL to use the WebGPU renderer.
//
// Two static-hosted source types:
//   - synthetic: a bundled shard streamed one chunk at a time over Range
//   - omezarr:   full upstream OME-Zarr stores read with zarrita, in either

// OME-Zarr stores resolve against a local copy first and the public Open SciVis

// only those that actually resolve reach the Level control. `stent` is bundled
// locally (scale2 only); the rest stream from the bucket as-is, and
// scripts/fetch-omezarr.ts can mirror any of them to disk.
//
// SCREEN EVERY STORE BEFORE ADDING IT HERE. A published pyramid can be broken in
// ways no renderer can compensate for, and the failure looks like a viewer bug:
// Z-periodic "venetian" striping. Two checks per level, both run against the
// decoded chunks directly (no viewer, no GPU):
//
//   (a) COMPLETENESS -- compare the z range that actually has chunks against the
//       declared shape. An absent chunk is "fill value" per the zarr spec, so a
//       level that covers less than the coarser level above it reads as empty
//       space there and the octree refines into a hole.
//   (b) PERIODICITY -- take a per-z-plane mean over a central window and
//       autocorrelate. A ripple (or hard zero runs) at the chunk period means the
//       level itself is banded on the chunk grid.
//
// A store needs at least one level that passes BOTH; if every level fails one,
// it cannot be rendered faithfully at any detail setting. The Open SciVis
// `pig_heart` store is the worked example and was dropped from this list for
// exactly that reason: its scale0 is clean but covers 25% of its declared z
// extent, while scale1 (the finest complete level) zeroes local z 54..80 of
// every 81-deep chunk, and scale2/scale3 carry that same defect averaged down
// into period-9 and period-2 ripples. Capping the level did not help, and
// ?nofloor was pixel-identical, because the striping is in the published bytes.
// The stores below all pass both checks at every level. Also deliberately
// absent: `3d_neurons_15_sept_2016`, which fails check (a) the same way
// (scale0 populates z 0..191 of a declared 1718, a contiguous 11% prefix, while
// scale1 carries real signal throughout, so it is usable only from scale1 down);
// and `woodbranch`, which passes both checks but is a dull thing to look at.
//
// A store outside the Open SciVis bucket sets `base` (an absolute URL that the
// store id is appended to) instead of resolving through the local mirror.
