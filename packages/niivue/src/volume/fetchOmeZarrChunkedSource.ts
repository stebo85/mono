/**
 * The public way to open an OME-Zarr store for `nv.loadChunkedVolume`.
 *
 * It is a thin layer over {@link openOmeZarrChunkedSource}: open the store on
 * this thread for its metadata, then, where a document and Workers allow it,
 * put the reads on a pool of chunk workers.
 *
 * The layering is deliberate rather than cosmetic. A chunk worker opens its own
 * store through `openOmeZarrChunkedSource`, so this module -- the only one that
 * knows about the pool, and through it about the bundler-resolved worker entry
 * -- must stay OUTSIDE what a worker imports. Fold the pool back into
 * `omeZarrChunkedSource.ts` and the worker's own module graph reaches the
 * worker entry again.
